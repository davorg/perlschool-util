# Perl School utilities

This repo contains

* a number of useful utility programs for producing Perl School books
* a Dockerfile that produces a Docker image with all of these utilities installed
* a GitHub Actions workflow that uses these utilities to regenerate the book

There are more details on these components below.

## About Perl School

The Perl School brand has its roots in a series of low-cost Perl training
courses that [Dave Cross](https://davecross.co.uk/) ran in 2012. By running
low-cost training at the weekend, he hoped to encourage more programmers to
keep their Perl knowledge up to date. These courses were run regularly for
about a year before the idea was put on hold for a while.

Dave always knew that he would want to return to the Perl School brand at some
point and late in 2017 he realised what the obvious next step was - low-cost
Perl books. He had already developed a pipeline for creating e-books from
Markdown files so it was a short step to republishing some of his training
materials as books.

The first Perl School book,
[*Perl Taster*](https://perlschool.com/books/perl-taster/) was published at
the end of 2017 (just in time for the London Perl Workshop). The second was
[*Selenium and Perl*](https://perlschool.com/books/selenium-perl/) and
[several more](https://perlschool.com/books/) have followed since then. This
book introduces a new author to the Perl School stable.
